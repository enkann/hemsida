                <h1>Alexander Engberg</h1>
                <h5>Developer</h5>
                <p>I'm Alexander Engberg, a 21-year-old with a deep love for computers and a knack for programming. My journey began when I decided to turn my fascination into a career path by diving headfirst into the world of coding, specifically focusing on .NET.
                    From school benches to coding projects, my passion has only grown. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking complex problems and transforming them into elegant lines of code. With every project, I'm not just learning; I'm creating a future where technology is the canvas.
                    Beyond the lines of code, I'm a strong communicator and an eager collaborator. Group discussions and public speaking don't faze me â€“ they energize me. I welcome criticism as a tool for growth, always looking to refine my skills and push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
                    Let's bring ideas to life through code!</p>
